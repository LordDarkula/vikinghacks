		<p>WE ARE NEVER EVER EVER GETTING BACK TOGETHER</p>
		
			<h3>What is a hackathon?</h3>
			<p>A hackathon is where you turn your crazy ideas into real stuff. Hundreds of hackers from across California will gather and build something they’re passionate about. 

			Come, dive in, and make the most incredible things you can imagine alongside fellow creators. You take care of building. We’ll take care of you.

			We will be following MLH's Code Of Conduct.
			</p>

			<h3>Who can attend?</h3>
			<p>
			HackDavis is open to all majors! As long as you're prepared to learn, brainstorm, and build cool things, we welcome you to join. 

			We will be holding workshops for students to immerse themselves into the world of hackathons and technology. These workshops will be held by industry professional who will teach new and upcoming tools that assist with web development, mobile development, and more.
			</p>

			<h3>Why social good?</h3>
			<p>
			We want people to build projects with a meaningful impact and hope to foster a community dedicated to social change. 

			We find that most hackathons often don’t result with projects as practical solutions to specific societal problems and we’re looking to change that. With every 50 projects submitted by participants at HackDavis, we will be donating a certain amount to each nonprofit organization involved.
			</p>

			<h3>What can I build?</h3>
			<p>
			You can build whatever your heart desires, whether its a web app, mobile app, hardware hack, or an open source tool. Any project under one of the three tracks (health/wellness, education, and environment) is recommended. 

			Though there will be prizes, our main focus is to bring you a learning experience and environment where you can thrive, ask questions, and bring your skills to the table.
			</p>

			<h3>What if I don't have a team or idea?</h3>
			<p>
				Don't worry, we'll have team forming sessions before the hackathon. We'll make sure you're equipped and ready to go!
			</p>

			<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
			<p>
				HackDavis is free for all admitted participants. Don't sweat it! We gotchu for your WiFi, meals, caffeine, swag, and workspace for the entire weekend.
